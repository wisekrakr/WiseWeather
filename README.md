# WiseWeather
An android app where you can look up the weather.

This is a basic android app, without all the bells and whistles.
I studied making apps, using js and json and handeling api's: this is culmination of those studies.

* signed up with openweather.org. Created an API key. 
* created an simple app with some textviews and a search button.
* created a "background" (DataGetter) class to handle background activities:
    * created method to open the url (with api key attached) and searchresults
    * created another method to fetch the right data from the url (JSON file form)
* in main activity, linked everything up. 
* app is done

TODO- list:

* The Async in MainActivity needs to be a background class too - easy
* Only one search per session, this needs to change - medium
* Give user the ability to choose what kind of information is shown - hard
